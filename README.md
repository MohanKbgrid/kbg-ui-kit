# @kbg/ui-kit

The KBG **visual and behavioural language**. Artifact 3 of the Platform Surfaces canon; read its
Experience surface spec first.

> The brief this exists to satisfy: *the UI/UX should be similar across projects — nobody should
> reinvent it every time.*

## What this is — and is not

**Not** a general component library. Projects already have those, and a second one competes badly.
This ships the parts of the Experience contract that every project otherwise re-argues and gets
wrong the same way:

| Export | What it prevents |
|---|---|
| **The eight states** | The two-state screen. Most software ships loading + happy and improvises the rest under deadline. |
| `DeniedState` | A hidden control. `reason` is a **required prop** — a silent denial does not compile. |
| `SyncIndicator` | A green tick that lies. State is *derived* from the queue, so a caller cannot claim synced with work pending. |
| `tokens.css` | Forty screens that each picked their own grey, and a semantic palette fused to the brand accent. |

Everything else — tables, forms, charts — stays with the project, built to the contract in the
spec. That is the canon's thesis applied to UI: ship the part where doing it *differently* is the
bug.

## How to use this: **VENDOR it, do not depend on it**

Copy `src/` into your project (e.g. `src/vendor/kbg-ui-kit/`) and own it from there, recording the
commit you copied from. There is deliberately no `npm install` instruction — this is a base, not a
dependency, so one product can never break another.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MohanKbgrid/kbg-ui-kit /tmp/kbg-ui
cp -r /tmp/kbg-ui/src  <your-project>/src/vendor/kbg-ui-kit/
git -C /tmp/kbg-ui rev-parse HEAD        # ← record this as the base commit
```

### ⚠️ One exception, and it matters: the TOKENS

`tokens.css` is the one file where divergence costs you the thing this package exists for —
**one product family feel.** Components carry logic and rightly adapt per product; a token sheet
carries none, so there is no "works for one, not the other" pressure on it. If four products each
edit their own copy, they simply drift apart visually and the family look is gone.

So: **vendor the components, keep the token sheet in sync.** At minimum, diff it against this repo
when something looks off:

```bash
diff /tmp/kbg-ui/src/tokens/tokens.css  <your-project>/src/vendor/kbg-ui-kit/tokens/tokens.css
```


## Use

```tsx
import '@kbg/ui-kit/tokens.css';
import { DeniedState, EmptyState, SyncIndicator } from '@kbg/ui-kit';

// Feed DeniedState from the SAME decision the API enforces with, so the disabled
// control and the 403 can never disagree (canon RBAC §3).
{!decision.enabled && (
  <DeniedState action="Correct this bill" reason={decision.reason} whoCan={decision.whoCan} />
)}

<SyncIndicator queuedCount={queue.length} queuedValue="₹48,300" lastSyncedAt={lastAt} />
```

Floor screens opt in to the touch minimum with a class, so the rule is enforced by CSS rather than
by a reviewer noticing:

```tsx
<main className="kbg-floor"> … </main>   /* every control ≥ --kbg-touch-min (44px) */
```

## Theming

Override the `:root` tokens. Do **not** redefine what a state or a denial looks like — that is the
part users carry between apps, and it is the whole point of the package.

## Verify

```bash
npm install
npm run typecheck     # tsc --noEmit, exits 0
node test_states.mjs  # the sync-state invariant + token rules
```

⚠️ `npx tsc` without a local install hits npm's placeholder package and **prints a message while
exiting 0** — a false green. Use the `typecheck` script, which resolves the real compiler.

## Versioning

`0.x` while its first consumers shake it out. Breaking changes go in the consuming project's
divergence register, not behind a compatibility shim.
